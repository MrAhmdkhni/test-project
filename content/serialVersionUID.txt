      ###################    what is the serialVersionUID in serialize & deserialize in java ⁉️⁉️   ###################
do you know what is the serialVersionUID in the serialize and deserialize java class? and what is the usage of it?

Imagine you have a box (which represents an object in Java) that you want to send to a friend (which represents another
part of your program, or even another program entirely). To send it, you need to pack it up (which is like serializing
the object). When your friend receives the box, they unpack it (which is like deserializing the object).
Now, suppose you and your friend want to make sure that the box hasn't changed during transit. So, you both agree on
a secret code (which is like the serialVersionUID). You write this code on the box before you send it. When your friend
receives the box, they check the code. If the code on the box matches the code you agreed on, they know the box is
exactly as you sent it. But if the codes don't match, they know something has changed, and they refuse to open the box.
In Java, when you serialize an object, the serialVersionUID is like the secret code you write on the box. And when you
deserialize the object, Java checks the serialVersionUID to make sure the object hasn't changed in a way that would be
incompatible with the rest of your program.
Here's an example:

import java.io.Serializable;

public class Box implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    // your code here
}

In this example, Box is a class that can be serialized, and serialVersionUID = 1L is the secret code. If you change the Box class in a way that would affect serialization, you should also change the serialVersionUID.

The serialVersionUID is a version number associated with a serializable class in Java. It's used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.
If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialVersionUID than that of the corresponding sender's class, then deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException.
A serializable class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by declaring a field named serialVersionUID that must be static, final, and of type long. For example:

private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then the serialization runtime will calculate a default serialVersionUID value for that class based on various aspects of the class. However, it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialVersionUID values, since the default serialVersionUID computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations, and can thus result in unexpected InvalidClassExceptions during deserialization.
Therefore, to guarantee a consistent serialVersionUID value across different java compiler implementations, a serializable class must declare an explicit serialVersionUID
